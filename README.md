Battleships
===========

Week three at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).

We're making the board game [battleships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) in Ruby. Our mission was to:

* use [CRC cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card) to thrash out a domain model of the game,
* present those findings to the group,
* use the domain model to build the game.
